<h1>Physical Exercise Website (Frontend Testing) 💪🖥️</h1>

<p>This repository is dedicated to testing frontend functionalities for a fitness website idea, based on a layout I saw on Figma. 🚀 The goal is to explore various frontend techniques and create a responsive, interactive user interface for an exercise platform. ⚡️</p>

<h3>Features to Test:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Responsive design 📱💻</li>
  <li>CSS layouts (Flexbox, Grid) 🧑‍🏫</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to explore the project, contribute, or check out the code to see how it’s all built! 🤩</p>
